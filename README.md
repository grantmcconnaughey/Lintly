# Lintly

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grantmcconnaughey/Lintly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/grantmcconnaughey/Lintly) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/grantmcconnaughey/lintly/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/grantmcconnaughey/lintly)

Automated GitHub PR code reviewer for Python, JavaScript, CSS, and more.

## Usage

First, `pip` install lintly:

    $ pip install lintly

> Lintly requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+.

Next, set the `LINTLY_API_KEY` environment variable to your GitHub API Key:

    $ export LINTLY_API_KEY="12345"

Finally, pipe the output of your linter to the `lintly` script:

    $ flake8 | lintly

Now you will see a review with linting errors...

![Lintly review on a pull request](./example_review.png)

...and a commit check...

![Lintly commit check on a pull request](./example_checks.png)

...on your pull requests! Nifty! ðŸŽ‰

## Supported Linters

- [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
    ```
    $ flake8 | lintly --format=flake8
    ```
- [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
    ```
    $ black . --check 2>&1 >/dev/null | lintly --format=black
    ```
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
    - For pylint you must use the `json` output format.
    ```
    $ pylint . --output-format=json | lintly --format=pylint-json
    ```
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
    ```
    $ eslint . | lintly --format=eslint
    ```
- [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
    ```
    $ stylelint . | lintly --format=stylelint
    ```
- [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
    ```
    $ bandit -r . --format=json | lintly --format=bandit-json
    ```

- [cfn-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint)
    ```
    $ cfn-lint template.yaml | lintly --format=cfn-lint
    ```

- [cfn-nag](https://github.com/stelligent/cfn_nag)
    ```
    $ cfn_nag_scan --input-path cloudformation-template.yaml --output-format=json | lintly --format=cfn-nag
    ```

Additional linters can be added by modifying the `lintly/parsers.py` module.

## Configuration

At a minimum Lintly needs to know the following information to determine how to post the correct GitHub PR Review:

- **GitHub API key** (`--api-key` or `LINTLY_API_KEY` env var)
    - Generate your own [API Key here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). The API key will need the following GitHub scopes:
        - `repo:status` so that Lintly can post commit statuses on PRs.
        - `public_repo` so that Lintly can create pull request reviews on public repos.
        - `repo` so that Lintly can create pull request reviews on private repos.
- **GitHub repository** (`--repo` or `LINTLY_REPO` env var)
    - This is your repository in the format `grantmcconnaughey/lintly`.
    > Note: Most Continuous Integration platforms will provide this value automatically.
- **Pull Request number** (`--pr` or `LINTLY_PR` env var)
    > Note: Most Continuous Integration platforms will provide this value automatically.

These configuration values can be provided to Lintly via environment variables, discovered automatically when run in a supported CI platform,
or by being passed in as arguments to the Lintly CLI.

### Options

A list of all configuration values can be viewed by running `lintly --help`.

```
Usage: lintly [OPTIONS]

                                  PRs (required)
  --repo TEXT                     The GitHub repo name in the format

                                  The linting output format Lintly should
                                  expect to receive. Default "flake8"
  --context TEXT                  Override the commit status context
  --fail-on [any|new]             Whether Lintly should fail if any violations
                                  are detected or only if new violations are
                                  detected. Default "any"
  --post-status / --no-post-status
                                  Used to determine if Lintly should post a PR

  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

## Supported Continuous Integration platforms

Lintly works out of the box with all of the CI platforms supported by [ci.py](https://github.com/grantmcconnaughey/ci.py#ci-services). To add support for new CI platforms create a PR to the ci.py repo.

When using these Continuous Integration platforms the repository, pull request number, and commit SHA will be detected automatically.

### GitHub Actions example

To use Lintly with GitHub Actions, create a file called `.github/workflows/lint.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
name: Lint

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install flake8 lintly
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: flake8 | lintly
      env:
        LINTLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Travis CI example

To use with Lintly with Travis CI, add the following to your `.travis.yml` config file:

```yml
language: python

jobs:
  include:
    - stage: lint
      install: pip install lintly
      script: flake8 | lintly --format=flake8

stages:
  - lint
```
